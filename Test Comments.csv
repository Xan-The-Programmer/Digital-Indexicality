2,Love your videos! You’re entertaining but provide great overviews.
28,The Will of the Many is a top tier book for sure!
1,"I want to be transported to a new world full of details, politics, trials, connecting details but limited or no spice. Any recommendations?"
37,I want to read wild reverence but I didn’t like divine rivals 😩
2,*sigh* adds all to my never ending tbr 🙃
9,"The series that had me GLUED was the Platted Prisoner series. This book has left me in a rut. I can not find a series that hooks me instantly, like that one 😔"
5,"Wild Reverence was my top read of this year, ugh I loved it so much"
0,Hmmm… which ones would you want in a movie??
3,no cause the ascended had me hooked before my brain could wander in typical ADHD brain
2,"I definitely can’t wait to read the Edge of Darkness and Tommen books in 2026. They have been on my TBR for awhile. I would recommend The Wolf King or Heir of Illusion instead of Direbound. Direbound, for me, was just mid. I will read the 2nd book and see how I feel afterwards."
1,I just started Wild Reverence after finishing Ruthless Vows (finally). I love the concept and world building of that duo but I had a hard time getting through the 2nd book. I wasn’t sure if Ruthless Vows would be the same. Instantly within the first few pages I was completely drawn in!
11,Do you need to read riftborne and duskbound before the ascended?
21,Every one of these are on kindle unlimited. This is the video I didn’t know I needed

1,You may as well be speaking French right now. These two genres are completely foreign to me. I read suspense and historical fiction. Occasionally a romance or drama. And perhaps I need to branch out.
